Set Dump Block Coordinates Plugin:

- This plugin searches for all blocks in the selection and dump their locations to a machine readable file type of your choosing including json & txt.
- I plan on adding support to somehow dump NBT data to files as well eventually, but may not do it anytime soon.
- Added support for ignoring air blocks and added some other new format types.
- If you have any issues with the plugin please reach out me for support.
