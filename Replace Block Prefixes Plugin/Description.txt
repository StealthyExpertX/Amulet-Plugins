Prefix Replacement Plugin:

- This plugin searches for all chunk's block palettes in your Minecraft world and replaces the prefixes in their block IDs and properties with a new prefix.
- Note: This plugin only alters block IDs and properties with a specified prefix; itâ€™s designed to work extremely fast with large selections and complex worlds.
- Note: The plugin does not impose any limit on the number of blocks you can modify at once. It also supports custom blocks.
- Note: I will update this plugin based on user feedback or if any issues arise.
- N/A
- If you encounter any issues with the plugin, feel free to reach out to me for support.
