Set CanPlaceOn CanDestroy Plugin:

- This plugin searches for any containers with items and sets the NBT data on the items so they can be either placed or destroyed in adventure mode.
- Note: This plugin will only work for adventure mode, this is a hardcoded mechanic and can't be changed.
- Note: The game has no limit to how many blocks you can have at one time, I bealive you can even use custom blocks.
- Note: I'll update the plugin if enough people request for me to do so or if it breaks.
- N/A
- If you have any issues with the plugin please reach out me for support.
