MCStructure Prefix Replacer Plugin:

- This plugin searches for any **.mcstructure** files and replaces the block ID and state ID prefixes with new ones.
- It is specifically useful for batch editing structures when the prefixes of custom blocks have been changed.
- Note: The plugin will only update the structure if block ID or state ID prefixes are found to replace.
- Note: There is no limit to how many blocks can be processed in one operation.
- If you encounter any issues with the plugin, please feel free to reach out for support.
